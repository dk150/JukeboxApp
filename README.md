# JukeboxApp
## Android Music Player App with Jukebox UI


â€¢ first Android app I made money on! ðŸ˜Ž (also my Bachelor Thesis in Computer Engineering & Information Theory from University of Belgrade)

â€¢ written Java, as I was familiar with it from college

â€¢ sold to EpicEscape Rooms: https://epicescape.rs/rooms/music/ - still running smoothly 2.5 years on ðŸ˜ƒ

â€¢ due to privacy issues, I won't be sharing any code here, just demo

â€¢ quite proud of it, but even more of how far I've come ðŸ’ª - if I were to re-open the project, I would refactor everything for sure at this point ðŸ™ˆ
